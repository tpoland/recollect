Known Issues:

- Add an open license
- Convert to Ruby functionality only (no shell commands)
- Need to reserve words so topics can't be (new, edit, remove, list, search)

Feature Requests:

- Make snippets directory ${HOME}/.recollect/
- Build in paging functionality
- Needs to obey ${EDITOR} environment variable (how does this play on Windows?)
- Allow for the creation of nested snippets (sub-directories)
  - when listing, count topics in subdirectories but don't list the individual snippets
- Add a search functionality that lists the snippet(s) containing the item searched for along with any matching content lines
- Create a mobile app synced via dropbox?
- add support for markdown instead of just txt files
